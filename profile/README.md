# IGE Calcul

Welcome to the *scientific computing platform* at the Institut Géosciences et Environnement (IGE) of the Université Grenoble Alpes (UGA).

Two unifying concepts motivate the existence of this community work: **open science** and **reproducible research**. Its ambition is to gather/create the human, documentary and material resources needed to simplify all aspects of scientific computing at the IGE.

## What we hope for

- 👋 Be the entry point for all users of scientific computing at the IGE
- 🗺️ Map all useful internal and external resources on the subject:
  - 🖨️ computing servers ;
  - 🏘️ data warehouses ;
  - 🛠️ tools et webservices ;
  - 📚 access and usage documentation ;
  - 🛤️ best practice guides and examples ;
  - 🏥 organizations that can provide support.
- 🎪 Set up a collegial organization for scientific computing, gather voluntary efforts
- 🏗️ Integrate support tools for recurring tasks and needs
- 👐 Promote diversity, openness and sharing
